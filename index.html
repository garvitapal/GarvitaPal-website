        <p class="lead mb-4">To stay motivated in a remote world, I think treating your space as if you were getting ready to leave your home is how I stay focused. Such as getting ready, and being dressed well. I enjoy google calendars to help me be prepared. I think organization and knowing my to-do list for today gives me that drive to check and mark everything I have to do. I love being responsible, and evacuating tasks on time gives me a great sense of achievement, especially online where I feel carrying out assignments is more enjoyable and straightforward. Lastly I think being happy with a dedicated workspace is quite motivating and following self care to be work at my best
<br><br>

        I have completed my early education in around 4 different countries. I spent my childhood in New Jersey, India, and Australia. Eventually moved to Canada to complete my elementary and middle school years, where I did my first working experience. I was an entrepreneur during 8th grade where I sold a product and made $300 in sales in one night, as this was a 1 year project part of my middle school's business programs. That is when I realized how much I enjoyed sales and working with customers. I also did a small side newspaper delivery business for 2 years in my local community. Eventually I got into an International Baccalaureate program, IB for high school, which is similar to an advanced placement program. Part of IB was to complete 120 hours in volunteering, so I explored my abilities and skills. Recognizing that I enjoy helping people. So I took up volunteer hours in clean up crews for big Canadian events and did retirement home volunteering, both of which I did for 2 years. When I moved to the states, I wanted to combine my love for business, sales and to help people with their wants and needs, so I decided to work as a POS associate in Dollar Tree as my first wage working job, for roughly 2 months. I am further proficient with computers. I have used this online platform since 4th grade, and I have developed incredible skills on a computer of any kind. I have completed years of python coding, java script as part of the many business programs I have been a part of. Recently, last summer I did microsoft and excel projects, also did unity creative coding projects on my laptop. I believe being a Gen Z student credits my abilities with computers because I have grown doing my education, hobbies, carried out extra curriculars all on computers, and am incredibly accustomed to this platform. 
<br><br>

       My previous job as a POS associate at Dollar Tree provided me with the ideal skill sets and experience for this position. I became proficient in my communication skills, furthered my listening and understanding abilities where I had to focus on what the customer needed and give exactly as to what they desired. I learned to strengthen problem solving skills, and utilized my optimism to form friendly relationships with customers. To the point where I recognize who they were and greet them if I see them at Dollar Tree again. I have never worked a wage job in a remote environment. But I am used to completing education such as online classes and zoom meetings, carrying out my hobbies such as blogging and posting for social life. I have done a couple of digital art advertisements for Black lives matter movement and currently run 2 websites, one for my business blog, and one for my grandma‚Äôs cancer journey where she promotes health and fitness videos. I enjoy working online, because I believe that it is important to stay aligned with the technological advancements this generation has seen. Therefore, given my online experience and having grown up in this remote world, I am more than comfortable working phone sales and other assignments remotely.
